## Getting started
To work on this project, follow these instructions

### Install Git
https://git-scm.com/

### Checkout the code
To checkout the code, open up a terminal (AKA command prompt) on your system. Then
change directory (`cd`) to the directory you want to checkout to and execute
the following git command:

`git clone git@github.com:sartell-coder-dojo/echo-shooter.git`

### Create a branch
If you would like to keep your changes separate from anyone else working on the
project, it is advised to create a new branch for your work. To create a branch
run the following command:

`git branch my-branch-name`

Then "checkout" that branch to switch to it:

`git checkout my-branch-name`

To save time, you can create a new branch and checkout that branch in one command
using the `-b <branch-name>` flag on the `checkout` command:

`git checkout -b my-branch-name`
